## Boost the performance and security of your dynamic website in few clicks using AWS edge services

This blog is written for developers who are looking to bring their website online if itâ€™s under DDoS attack, or looking for a quick web performance win, or simply looking to get started with setting up a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for their website.

We are assuming that it is a dynamic website, such as a Server Side Rendered frontend, with some static content, that is served from regional servers, such as an Elastic Load balancer, or servers on premises.
